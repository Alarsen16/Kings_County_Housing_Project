# Kings_County_Housing_Project

## Overview
We have been approached by a real estate company about how to accurately appraise homes in Kings County so that they can give their customers accurate reccomendations when it comes to buying and selling homes. We've been given a data set that contains various information about the different homes within Kings County.
## Business Understanding
We'll be looking to answer the following questions to help us better understand the layout of the housing industry.

* How does number of rooms effect the price?
* How does square footage matter?
* Are there any other features that effect the price significantly?
